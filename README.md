A simple project that uses Selenium and Python to screen scrape a rumble live stream to get the live user count and post it to a text file for OBS to read.

I run this on a windows machine using Task Scheduler and in a batch file.

I have found the script runs in just under 10secs in CMD and PowerShell.
