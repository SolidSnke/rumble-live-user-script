A simple project that uses Selenium and Python to screen scrape a rumble live stream to get the live user count and post it to a text file for OBS to read.

I run this on a windows machine using Task Scheduler and in a batch file.

I have found the script runs in just under 10secs in CMD and PowerShell.

INSTALLATION;
just need to install Python - https://www.python.org/
and install Selenium - https://www.selenium.dev/
  - you want the web driver, there docs are here; https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/
  - basically from PowerShell i type; pip install selenium
  - after that you should be good to go on running the script
